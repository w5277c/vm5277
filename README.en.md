# vm5277 Embedded Java-like Toolkit
**Java-like embedded toolkit for Atmel, Microchip, STM8, and other MCUs**

Universal platform for embedded development (Java-like j8b syntax + RTOS + cross-platform drivers for 8-bit MCUs)

## Manifesto

I am creating this toolkit because I believe embedded development can be made more convenient.
Simply by removing C from it, replacing it with low-level programming in assembly and high-level programming in an OOP language with a Java-like syntax.
All without sacrificing performance or control.

This is an alternative for those who also think it can be simpler, more convenient, and more efficient — and who are ready to try a different way.
Yes, it can be better without C, as Java has shown in the enterprise world, and I will strive to prove this with my project.

## Getting Started with J8B
For a step-by-step introduction to J8B development, check out:  
**[VM5277: Introduction to J8B Development](docs/devel_intoduction/index.md)**  
This guide walks you through creating your first project, compiling, and flashing to MCUs.

*(Full documentation is currently in progress and will be expanded.)*
